All About Char'Lesia Baby!!</h1>
<p>Hi,
  my name is Char'lesia Hughes. I am 16 years old and I have over 5 siblings. My dad is from Nigeria and my mom is from Chicago.
 I joined Girls Who Code because of the sisterhood aspect and because I have always wanted to code because it's cool and women
 lack jobs in the coding feild and I will like to change that.Coding allowed me to be more opended minded about things and it showed
     me that it's okay to not know the answer all the time and that it's perfectly fine to have a lot of questions because 
     I was learning a new skill that I had no experince with..</p> 
 
 </body> I have had great experience at the program Girls Who Code.</body>
<ui> One of my favorite expriences was when we created our own games because it allowed me
 to show my creativity and knowledge.<ui/>
