<h1>All About Char'Lesia Baby!!</h1>
<p>Hi,
  my name is Char'lesia Hughes. I am 16 years old and I have over 5 siblings. My dad is from Nigeria and my mom is from Chicago.
  I have over 70 hours of community services and I am just only going into my junior year. However, I am very passionate about 
  helping the homeless and bringing awareness to the problems that many homeless people face around the world.</p>
