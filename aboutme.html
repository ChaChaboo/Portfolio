<h1>All About Char'Lesia Baby!!</h1>
<p>Hi,
  my name is Char'lesia Hughes. I am 16 years old and I have over 5 siblings. My dad is from Nigeria and my mom is from Chicago.
 I joined Girls Who Code because of the sisterhood aspect and because I have always wanted to code because it's cool and women
 lack jobs in the coding feild and I will like to change that.</p>
